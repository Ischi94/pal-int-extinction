# pal-int-extinction
This is the repository for the manuscript **Extinction risk controlled by interaction of long-term and short-term climate change** currently in review at *Nature Ecology and Evolution*.  
In the folder *example-code* we deposited clean and concise R-scripts showing how to download data, clean it, and fit a model. Each R script is commented to guide the reader through each analytical step.  
The raw data sets used in our analysis are stored in here as well and results can be reproduced by substituting the data set/ taxon of interest with the examplatory bivalve data set used throughout the scripts. Further explanations on how to do this can be found in the commented script.  
The raw and less structured R scripts for the remaining taxa can be found in the file *raw-code*. Please note that the uploaded structure may not fit with the github structure, and thus, some working directories probably need to be adjusted manually to get the script running. This R files are less commented than the *examplatory-code* and for a better overview we refer the reader to the examplatory code. Results can still be reproduced there by substituting the data files for further processing steps.
