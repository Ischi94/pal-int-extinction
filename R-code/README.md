This is the subfile for the code repository of this project. In the folder *example-code* you will find clean and concise R-scripts showing how to download data, clean it, and fit a model. Each R script is commented to guide the reader through each analytical step.  
The raw data sets used in our analysis are stored in here as well and results can be reproduced by substituting the data set/ taxon of interest with the examplatory bivalve data set used throughout the scripts.  
The raw and less structured R scripts for the remaining taxa can be found in the file *raw-code*. Please note that the uploaded structure may not fit with the github structure, and thus, some working directories probably need to be adjusted manually to get the script running. This R files are less commented than the *examplatory-code* and for a better overview we refer the reader to these files. Results can still be reproduced here by substituting the data files for further processing steps.
